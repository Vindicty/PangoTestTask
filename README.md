# ðŸ“± Mobile Weather App Test Framework

This is a UI + API test automation framework for a mobile weather application.  
It uses **Python**, **Pytest**, **Appium**, **pytest-html**, and **SQLite**.

The framework is designed for clarity, maintainability, and extendability.  
It follows clean architecture principles and good testing practices.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… UI Tests with Appium
- Launch the mobile weather app on an emulator or real device
- Set temperature units via the settings page
- Retrieve temperature values from the app
- Compare the values with OpenWeather API
- Log results and fail the test if there's a mismatch

### âœ… API + DB Validation
- Fetch data from the OpenWeather API
- Save it into a local SQLite database
- Validate the consistency of stored values

### âœ… Parametrized Testing
I use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run tests for multiple cities.  
This enables:
- Independent test results for each city
- Easier debugging
- Clean and scalable structure

### âœ… HTML Reporting (`pytest-html`)
- A styled HTML report is generated after every test run
- The report includes:
  - Summary and test results
  - Attached HTML table showing cities with temperature mismatches (API vs APP)
- Output is saved to:  
  `automation_framework/tests/logs/report.html`

### âœ… Logging
- Global logger (`logger.py`) captures key actions:
  - App installation
  - API calls
  - Database writes
- Logs are saved to:  
  `automation_framework/tests/logs/test_run.log`

### âœ… SQLite Support
- Data is stored in `data.db`
- Auto-creation of tables on the first run
- Easily query mismatches by city

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### âœ… Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Appium server running
- Android emulator or real device
- Android SDK with emulator properly configured

### ðŸ”½ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### â–¶ Run Tests
```bash
pytest
```

By default, the test report will be saved to:  
`automation_framework/tests/logs/report.html`

## ðŸ§ª Example Report

The report includes:
- Environment and platform info
- Per-test status (Passed, Failed)
- Embedded HTML table showing cities with mismatches (if any)

You can view the report by opening the HTML file directly in your browser.

## âœ… Status

This framework is under active development and serves as a clean reference project  
for combining mobile UI, API testing, and reporting.

Contributions and improvements are welcome!
